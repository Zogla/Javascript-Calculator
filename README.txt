A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/vogtn/pen/pbEdRz.

 This calculator was created using primarily javascript, jQuery, css, and html + (bootstrap framework) . The purpose is to ultilize primary math functions to emulate a basic calculator. 

Things I learned: 
 1. When many functions are dependant on simple button presses, and there are many buttons, it is easier to set value of each button first in the HTML. From there you can easily manipulate the values using jQuery. 
 2. Initilizing start messages and global variables typically happen before DOM ready.
